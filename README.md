# CNP4-Nsp13-C-terminus-B
An [SGC]((https://www.thesgc.org/)) Open Chemistry Networks Project (number 4) devoted to a site on the SARS-CoV-2 Non-structural protein 13 (NSP13)

The site of interest is "C-terminus-B" referred to by [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25166-6) that reported the original fragment screen. (Not the RNA or nucleotide site).

You contribute synthetic chemistry and in return the SGC offers biology. Together we can generate tool compounds to understand biology and validate drug targets to help cure disease. Everything is open, with all content governed by a CC-BY-4.0 licence.

If this sounds interesting, and you agree to the simple [RULES](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/terms-of-use), you can get started.

For the science background, head to the [wiki](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP4-Nsp13-C-terminus-B/wiki) or check out the living paper that is being written [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16e_yZ9joQDpFkxyyfJj_dWWr5ZW_HEya9e_PG8kaF5M/edit?usp=sharing) (link is also https://tinyurl.com/SGC-CNP4).

For answers to all the questions you have, go to the [FAQs](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/faq).

If you'd like to contact someone to talk about contributing, then write something in an [Issue](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP4-Nsp13-C-terminus-B/issues) (see the tab above), which is a good way to communicate openly. (Issues describe what currently needs doing and act as a discussion forum - you need a Github account but it's super easy and not spammy. To tag everyone involved in this project on Github use "@StructuralGenomicsConsortium/cnp4-nsp13". There's also an email address (chemistry@thesgc.org) you can use to ask questions.

Current scientific status of the project is on the [wiki](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP4-Nsp13-C-terminus-B/wiki) (you can always find the relevant tab above). The current version of the research paper describing this project is NEEDED here and is a great place to start if you're new to all this.
